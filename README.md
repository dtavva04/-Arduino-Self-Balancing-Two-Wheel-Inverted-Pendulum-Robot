# Arduino Self-Balancing Two-Wheel Inverted Pendulum Robot
This repository summarizes my 2024 summer project in which I learned how to simulate, design, and build a self-balancing inverted pendulum using PID control.

I discovered three common designs:

- Pole on a moving cart on rails
- Fixed reaction wheel
- Two-Wheel Robot

This project attempted the third (because it looks cool).

Credits to the original creator of these libraries: I2Cdev, MPU6050, PID.
